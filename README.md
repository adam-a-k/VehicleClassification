# VehicleClassification

This is a K means classifier written in R that I made at university under the Machine Learning and Data Mining module. The aim was for the program to be able to classify visual data for four different vehicles - a van, a bus and two different types of cars (Opel and Saab). For this, the vehicles dataset (which you can find in the repository) was split into training and testing datasets. For more details, please read the PDF attached.
